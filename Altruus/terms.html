	   <p>These Altruus Web and Mobile User Terms & Conditions (the “<b>Agreement</b>”) form a binding agreement between the registering user (“<b>User</b>” or “<b>You</b>”) and Altruus LLC, 
	   a Texas limited liability company (“<b>Altruus</b>”). If you do not wish to be bound by this Agreement, then do not click to accept the terms, do not complete the registration process, 
	   and do not use the Altruus Platform (as defined below). This Agreement will be effective as of the date you register a User Account (the “<b>Effective Date</b>”).</p>
	   <ol>
			<li><u>Altruus Platform</u>. Altruus offers Users access to its website (the “<b>Site</b>”) and the integrated web application and mobile application (collectively with the Site, the “<b>Platform</b>”) 
				through which Users can register for a personal user account (a “<b>User Account</b>”) in order to view and accept marketing promotions (“<b>Offers</b>”), such as discounts or giveaways, 
				created by businesses registered with Altruus (“<b>Merchants</b>”) and otherwise access the information and functionality available on the website.<br/><br/>

				parent or legal guardian.<br/><br/>
			<li><u>User Requirements</u>. In order for you to use the Platform and be eligible for Offers, you must, and hereby do, allow Altruus, the Platform, and Merchants from which 
				you accept Offers to access your Facebook account and/or Twitter account (“<b>Social Media Access</b>”). Social Media Access includes allowing Altruus to post a message 
				on your Facebook wall and/or a tweet to your Twitter account for each Offer you accept (“<b>Social Media Communications</b>”). By using the Platform and accepting Offers, 
				whether by scanning the QR codes provided by Merchants or otherwise, you acknowledge that the Platform will create and publish Social Media Communications on your behalf. 
				Social Media Communications are written by the applicable Merchant and any questions or concerns regarding the content of Social Media Communications should be directed to 
				the applicable Merchant. Social Media Access further includes allowing Altruus to access and aggregate your Facebook and Twitter contacts and your contacts on the mobile 
				device on which you installed the Platform, and to access and aggregate GPS and other location information from the mobile device on which you installed the Platform. 
				To remain eligible for Offers, you must also maintain Facebook Privacy Settings that allow at least one of the following categories of people to view your Facebook posts: 
				(a) Public; (b) Friends; or (c) Friends of Friends.<br/><br/>
			<li><u>Registration and Account Information</u>. When you register for an Altruus account, you will choose a username and password. You represent and warrant that the information 
				you supply during the registration process is true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself. If the information becomes inaccurate, then it is your 
				responsibility to update your registration. If Altruus has reasonable grounds to believe that your registration information is untrue, inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated, 
				then Altruus may suspend or terminate your use of the Platform. Altruus may disallow the use of any username that Altruus deems offensive or inappropriate. You are 
				responsible for preserving the confidentiality of your password and for the actions of persons accessing the Platform through usernames and passwords selected by you.
